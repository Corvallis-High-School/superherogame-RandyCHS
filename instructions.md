# Instructions
Complete the Superhero game by following the steps below (the steps are also listed as TODOs in each class file of the project)
## Steps
1. Add any missing constructors to the Superhero class so that the code in the Main class compiles. Note that the Superhero's life attribute should default to true and the weaponStrength attribute should default to 0.
2. Add any missing methods to the Superhero class so that the code in the Main class compiles.
3. Make sure that each superhero's details are printed out nicely to the command line. Hint: a toString() method can help with this.

Your output be similar to the following to pass the input / output test:

```
Superhero details
    name: Spiderman
    costume: Red suit
    weapon: Super Web
    life: true
    weapon strength: 0

Superhero details
    name: Batman
    costume: Batsuit
    weapon: Super Strength
    life: false
    weapon strength: 0
```
